1. Create chess web application div element that:
   * imbeddable or attachable to a specififed div
   * written in pure HTML, CSS, JS for compatibility
   * displays board
   * draggable pieces
   * a function that can take in moves and automatically move pieces
   * a function whuch can be enabled/disabled to do move validation checks and allow/reject moves accordingly
2. Chess engine:
   * Backend written in Python Flask
   * CPython module to handle game logic and calculate "best" moves (because Python is horrendously slow from past experiences)"
3. Overall:
   * Extremely adaptable code that makes adding addition features (like a chess puzzle feature) seemless
   *
